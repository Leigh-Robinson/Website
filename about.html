            <article>
                <h2>I'm a web designer and developer based in Cambridge, U.K.</h2>
                <p>I first started building websites in the late 1990's with only a basic understanding of HTML. In 2002 I built my first ecommerce website using OsCommerce. At this stage it wasn't a 'drag and drop' system that easily builds the site, you had to install folders and pages with data. I somehow managed to get it all working.</p>
                <p>I really enjoyed building the ecommerce site and would've liked to have learnt more about coding. I couldn't find any classes to learn so I tried learning from books. This didn't work for me as I would get one character wrong in my code, it wouldn't work and I had no way of knowing how to find and fix it.</p>
                <p>In 2009 I wanted to start a small ecommerce business. Technology had moved forward and now I could use 'drag and drop' to build an ecommerce site. I built a small jewellery business using Volusion. I later migrated to Shopify and continue to use it for my ecommerce business today.</p>
