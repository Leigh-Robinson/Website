                <h2>Where it all began.</h2>
                <p>
                    I first started building websites in the late 1990's with only a basic understanding of HTML. 
                    In 2002 I built my first ecommerce website using OsCommerce. At this stage it wasn't a 'drag and drop'
                    system that easily builds the site, you had to install folders and pages with data. I somehow managed to
                    get it all working.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    I really enjoyed building the ecommerce site and would've liked to have learnt more about coding.
                    I couldn't find any classes to learn so I tried learning from books. This didn't work for me as I would
                    get one character wrong in my code, it wouldn't work and I had no way of knowing how to find and fix it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2009 I wanted to start a small ecommerce business. Technology had moved forward and now I could use
                    'drag and drop' to build an ecommerce site. I built a small jewellery business using Volusion. I later 
                    migrated to Shopify and continue to use it for my ecommerce business today.
