            <h2>Decide what you need.</h2>
            <p>
              Do you need a brand new website or updates to an existing one? How involved in
              running and maintenance do you want to be? Your website has to be stored somewhere
              this is called hosting. Do you want to be involved in setting up and maintaining the
              hosting? If you're not sure what you need, here's our questionaire to help
            </p>
            <h2>Establish a Budget</h2>
            <p>
                When determining your budget, ensure you allocate sufficient funds for 
                your web development project. As with any financial planning, determine 
                what your company can comfortably invest and use that as your baseline.
                For instance, if your marketing budget for Q3 is £10,000 and you wish to 
                allocate 25% to your website, your initial budget is £2,500. While you 
                might find developers willing to work for less, it's prudent to spend 
                close to your budget to ensure quality.

How to Choose a Web Design Company
https://www.exposure.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-web-design-company/



Always request a clear pricing structure upfront. 
Some developers might be out of your budget range, but remember, there 
are numerous others available.
Conversely, some might offer very low rates, 
possibly indicating they modify existing templates rather than creating custom 
designs. Ensure you understand what's included in their fee by asking about:

Mid-project design changes
Additional features or widgets
Post-launch troubleshooting
If their pricing aligns with your budget, consider them for the next evaluation 
stage.

Review Case Studies
Case studies offer invaluable insights into a designer's capabilities. 
To narrow down your options:
Explore the designer's website for portfolios or case studies.
Search online for relevant case studies, e.g., "restaurant web design examples".
During discussions, request case studies from potential designers.
Broaden your search based on your objectives. If you're aiming for a successful 
eCommerce platform, seek out relevant case studies. Present these to potential 
designers to clarify your expectations.

Assess Client Retention
A high client retention rate often indicates quality service. Long-term client 
relationships suggest the designer has successfully navigated challenges and 
adapted over time. Conversely, short-term relationships might indicate potential 
issues. Don't hesitate to ask designers about their client retention and the 
reasons behind it.

Identify Your Primary Contact
Understanding who will manage your project helps establish a strong working 
relationship from the outset. Key qualities to seek in this individual include:

Active listening skills
Passion for their work
Creative problem-solving abilities
Prompt and professional communication
Remember, effective communication is often more valuable than mere technical prowess.

Evaluate Their Support System
Ensure the designer's customer support aligns with your preferences. 
Some might use a ticket-based system, which might not offer predictable 
response times. Others might offer personalised support, potentially from the 
designer themselves. Choose a system that provides you with peace of mind.

Discuss Site Relocation
Whether you're creating a new site or moving an existing one, it's crucial to 
know if your designer can handle hosting transitions. If you're familiar with 
hosting migrations, this might not be a priority, but it's always good to clarify.

Agree on Clear Milestones and Deadlines
Defining clear milestones and deadlines offers several advantages:

Facilitates business planning around website readiness.
Demonstrates the designer's professionalism and commitment.
Simplifies the payment process.
Without clear milestones, the project can become ambiguous.

Choosing the Ideal Web Design Partner
If a designer meets all the above criteria, they might be the right fit. 
Before finalising, reflect on any additional requirements or questions you 
might have. For some, active involvement in the design process is crucial. 
Ensure your chosen designer is receptive to your input.

By following these guidelines, you can confidently select the perfect 
designer from a vast pool of options. Remember, the right choice will make 
all the difference in your project's success.
