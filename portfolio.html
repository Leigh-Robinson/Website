                <h1>About this website</h1>
                <p>
                    This website was hand-coded with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was 
                    really fun to build. I will convert it into a React website once I 
                    am more confident with React.
                </p>
                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <h3>Structuring files</h3>
                <p> As a first solo project building the website has brought many challenges.
                    The file structure quickly evolved when I realised I would be reusing quite
                    a bit of code such as the navigation bar. I realised that by splitting the css
                    files I could seperate the reusable code, contain it and control it independantly.
